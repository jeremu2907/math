## Math

### Euler's Formula & Identity
Euler's identity
$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
links five fundamental mathematical constants — $0$, $1$, $e$, $i$, and $\pi$ — in a single, simple formula, showing a deep connection between exponentials, complex numbers, and trigonometry.

### Nth Order Homogeneous ODE With Constant Coefficient Solution
A derivation of the general solution to the differential equation of the form

$$
y^{(n)} + a_1y^{(n - 1)} + a_2y^{(n - 2)} + ... + a_ny = 0
$$

is

$$
y = \sum_{k = 1}^{n}{C_{k1}e^{a_{k}x}\cos(b_{k}x) + C_{k2}e^{a_{k}x}\sin(b_{k}x)}
$$

## Circuits
### Natural Response of a Series LC Circuit
This section derives the natural response of a series LC circuit, showing how voltage and current oscillate sinusoidally at the natural frequency due to energy exchange between the inductor and capacitor.
